The database is defined using the `db` attribute macro on a module:

> `db(`
>
>> The name of the database.  
>>
>> Default: the module name.  
>>
>> `name =` `<String>` `,`
>
> `)`

Each table is defined using the `db` attribute on a struct in the module:

>>
>> Default: the struct name.  
>>
>> `name =` `<String>` `,`

>>> Default: `false`.

>> It can also be implemented manually for extra control.  
>>
>> `controller(`
>>
>>> The type to use for authentication and authorization.  
>>> It must implement the `Ã€uthorize` trait.

Each column is defined using the `db` attribute on a field in the struct:

>> `name =` `<String>` `,`
