# Laraxum

Create API database servers easily using Axum and SQLX.
It uses the MVC paradigm:

- Model: manages the data storage and interacts with the database.
- View: manages the data input/output and interacts with the end user.
- Controller: manages the connection between model and view.

This framework is only responsible for creating backend half of an app,
meaning the model and controller.
You can create your own frontend, meaing the view.
Or you can just use it as an API and interact with the controller.

## Model

A model manages the data storage and interacts with the database.  
It implements the `Collection` trait:

- `get_all` Return all records.
- `create_one` Create a record.

and the `Model` trait:

- `get_one` Return a record.
- `create_get_one` Create a record and return it.
- `update_one` Update a record.
- `update_get_one` Update a record and return it.
- `patch_one` Patch update a record.
- `patch_get_one` Patch update a record and return it.
- `delete_one` Delete a record.

### ManyModel

A manymodel is similar to a model but with two columns.
The `ManyModel` trait can be implemented for each column.
The column will be used as an id for multiple values in the other column.  
This can be used to create many-to-many relationships.

## Controller

A controller manages the connection between model and view.  
It implements the `Controller` trait:

- `get_many` Return records.
- `get` Return a record.
- `create` Create a record and return it.
- `update` Update a record and return it.
- `patch` Patch update a record and return it.
- `delete` Delete a record.

- `GetManyRequestQuery` The query parameters that can be used for custom requests using indexes.

- `type State` The stateful context of the controller,
which contains the database connection.

- `type Auth` Request authentication.  
`AuthToken<()>` doesn't do any authentication.  
You can implement the authenticate trait for custom authentication and use it like `AuthToken<T>`.  

## Db

The database is defined using the `db` attribute macro on a module:

>`db(`
>
>>The name of the database.  
>>Default: the module name.  
>>
>>`name =` `<String>` `,`
>
>`)`

Each struct in the module is a table. Use the `db` attribute on the struct:

>`db(`
>
>>The name of the table in the database.  
>>Default: the struct name.  
>>
>>`name =` `<String>` `,`
>
>>Implement model.  
>>
>>`model(`
>>
>>>Implement manymodel instead of model.  
>>>Use the `struct_name` attribute to change the type used to refer to each column.  
>>>Default: `false`.  
>>>
>>>`many =` `<bool>` `,`
>>
>>`),`
>
>>Implement controller.  
>>
>>`controller(`
>>
>>>The type to use for authentication and authorization.  
>>>It must implement the `Ã€uthorize` trait.
>>>Anything that implements that the `Authenticate` trait also
>>>automatically implements the `Authorize` trait.  
>>>
>>>`auth(` `<Type>` `),`
>>

>
>>A custom request type for the controller.

>>Includes all indexes for this table that have set the `controller` attribute.  
>>A query with the corresponding keys will select one of the indexes and fetch using that index.  
>>
>>`index_name(` `<Ident>` `),`
>
>`)`

Each field in the struct is a column. Use the `db` attribute on the field:

>`db(`
>
>>The name of the column in the database.  
>>Default: the field name.  
>>
>>`name =` `<String>` `,`
>
>>Optional type information in addition to the field's type.  
>>They can change the behavior of the column and only work with specific types.  
>>Without this, each field will behave as a normal readable/writable column.

If you don't use the controller option, the controller won't be implemented.
You can implement it yourself or not at all.
The functions have a default implementation so you don't have to implement each one by yourself.

### Example

```rs
#[db(name = "database")]
pub mod AppDb {
    #[db(name = "addresses", model(), controller())]
    pub struct Address {
        #[db(ty(id))]
        id: u64,
        #[db(ty(varchar = 255))]
        street: String,
        #[db(ty(char = 5))]
        postcode: String,
        #[db(ty(varchar = 255))]
        city: String,
    }
    #[db(name = "contacts", model(), controller())]
    pub struct Contact {
        #[db(ty(id))]
        id: u64,
        #[db(ty(foreign()), request(name = "address_id"), name = "address_id")]
        address: Address,
        #[db(ty(varchar = 255))]
        firstname: String,
        #[db(ty(varchar = 255))]
        lastname: String,
        #[db(ty(varchar = 16))]
        mobile: String,
        #[db(ty(varchar = 16))]
        landline: String,
        #[db(ty(varchar = 255))]
        email: String,
    }
    #[db(name = "groups", model(), controller())]
    pub struct Group {
        #[db(ty(id))]
        id: u64,
        #[db(ty(varchar = 255))]
        title: String,
    }
    #[db(name = "users", model(), controller())]
    pub struct User {
        #[db(ty(id))]
        id: u64,
        #[db(ty(foreign(many(model(GroupUser)))))]
        groups: Vec<Group>, // many to many relationship
        #[db(ty(foreign()), request(name = "contact_id"), name = "contact_id")]
        contact: Contact,
        #[db(ty(varchar = 255))]
        name: String,
        #[db(ty(varchar = 255), unique, index(name(UserEmail)), borrow(str))] // <User as CollectionIndexOne<UserEmail>>
        email: String,
        #[db(ty(varchar = 255), response(skip), request(validate(min_len(12))))]
        password: String,
        #[db(ty(on_create))]
        created_at: chrono::DateTime<chrono::Utc>,
        #[db(ty(on_update))]
        updated_at: chrono::DateTime<chrono::Utc>,
        admin: bool
    }
    #[db(name = "group_user", many_model)]
    pub struct GroupUser {
        #[db(ty(foreign()), request(name = "group_id"), name = "group_id")]
        group: Group,
        #[db(ty(foreign()), request(name = "user_id"), name = "user_id")]
        user: User,
    }
}
```

## Auth

Implement the `Authenticate` trait to allow custom authentication that can be used in the controller.
`AuthToken<T>` should be returned from the login endpoint, which will encrypt it.
To authenticate the request, it will be decrypted.

Implement the authorize trait for custom authorization.
You must specify a type that is authenticatable.

### Example

```rs
#[derive(serde::Serialize, serde::Deserialize)]
struct UserAuth {
    is_admin: bool,
}
/// Implementation agnostic logic for authentication.
///
/// Implementing this also implements the `Authorize` trait.
///
/// Anything can implement the `Authorize` trait to extend it and add custom authorization logic.
impl Authenticate for UserAuth {
    type State = AppDb;
    /// Executes after user is authenticated.
    ///
    /// You can add extra authentication logic that applies for all users.
    fn authenticate(&self, state: &Arc<Self::State>) -> Result<(), AuthError> {
        // authenticate the user
        Ok(())
    }
}
/// Token specific logic for authenticatiion.
///
/// Has sensible defaults which can customised, like the expiration time.
impl AuthenticateToken for UserAuth {}

/// A struct using the `UserAuth` token for authentication and extending it with authorization logic.
struct UserAuthAdmin;
impl Authorize for UserAuthAdmin {
    /// Use `UserAuth` for authentication.
    type Authenticate = UserAuth;
    /// Add extra authorization logic.
    fn authorize(authorize: Self::Authenticate) -> Result<Self, AuthError> {
        if authorize.is_admin {
            Ok(UserAuthAdmin)
        } else {
            Err(AuthError::Unauthorized)
        }
    }
}

mod AppDb {
    #[db(model(), controller())]
    struct Anyone {}

    #[db(model(), controller(auth(UserAuth)))]
    struct UserOnly {}

    #[db(model(), controller(auth(UserAuthAdmin)))]
    struct AdminOnly {}
}
```
